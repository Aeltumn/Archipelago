## What does randomization do to this game?

Levels, Masks, Cages, Silver Lums, and Super Yellow Lums are all moved around.

The order of levels will change, they are mostly random with a few exceptions:
- The Prison Ship and Crow's Nest are always the last two levels.
- Menhir Hills will always appear after the Marshes of Awakening.
- Mask levels are in the same spots but are shuffled amongst themselves.
- One of the first few level will give you a Silver Lum, at least before you encounter any Purple Lums. (as the first Silver Lum unlocks swining on Purple Lums)

Masks, Cage Contents, Silver Lums, and Super Yellow Lums are all randomised between each other. When you destroy a cage its contents are what is randomised, so you may not be able to acquire all lums in a level if the cage contained lums. Cages that contain teensies are not randomised.
